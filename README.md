# Lucina
Lucina is goddess of light and creation

This directory aims to group the images and creations that we need to make public as a CDN in order to facilitate the use by our third-party applications.

# Naming convention
Photos filenames must use the following syntax:
```bash
# When processing, make sure to replace placeholders with their appropriate values.
your.name@company.com.jpg
```

# Usage
Each organization has it's own `directory`, with all of the employees photos regrouped inside.
```bash
lucina
└─ organization
   └─ your.name@company.com.jpg
```
